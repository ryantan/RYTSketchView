/* public static function curveThroughPoints
 *	Draws a smooth curve through a series of points. For a closed curve, make the first and last points the same.
 *	@param:
 *		g:Graphics			-Graphics on which to draw the curve
 *		p:Array				-Array of Point instances
 *		z:Number			-A factor (between 0 and 1) to reduce the size of curves by limiting the distance of control points from anchor points.
 *							 For example, z=.5 limits control points to half the distance of the closer adjacent anchor point.
 *							 I put the option here, but I recommend sticking with .5
 *		angleFactor:Number	-Adjusts the size of curves depending on how acute the angle between points is. Curves are reduced as acuteness
 *							 increases, and this factor controls by how much.
 *							 1 = curves are reduced in direct proportion to acuteness
 *							 0 = curves are not reduced at all based on acuteness
 *							 in between = the reduction is basically a percentage of the full reduction
 *		moveTo:Bollean		-Specifies whether to move to the first point in the curve rather than continuing drawing
 * 							 from wherever drawing left off.
